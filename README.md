Hello!

This is my Login Challenge! It's a Server Side Rendering project, developed with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and using: 

* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [React Hooks](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
* [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/docs/api)
* [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) 
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

I didn't use Redux and Redux Saga because i thought wasn't necessary. It's not a project that needs a "context", where a lot of components send and receive props to each other making you fell lost with all props between them. But, i know about the obligatoriness, i'm sorry for this! 

Well, let's evaluate this?

## Getting Started
First of all, you'll need install [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [YARN](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) to manage the libraries and packages. Then, you need to install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
